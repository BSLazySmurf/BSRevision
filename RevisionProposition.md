##Blade Symphony Australia - Revision Proposition

WIP: Subject to change, don't take anything in this as concrete until completion.

We feel, the latest changes made to the Blade Symphony balance while mostly keeping balance in the game have been pushing it in a direction that is	a little unorthodox for a fighter and just not as fun as it used to be.
