##Blade Symphony Australia - Revision Proposition

WIP: Subject to change, don't take anything in this as concrete until completion.

We feel, the latest changes made to the Blade Symphony balance while mostly keeping balance in the game have been pushing it in a direction that is	a little unorthodox for a fighter and just not as fun as it used to be.

###Arguments

//I ramble a bit here but we can change shit.

Most of the latest changes made to the balance by the current balance team are recovery changes, if some thing needs buffing they just reduce the recoveries, this worked at first and made the game more fluid, but it hit a point where it started reducing counter play and is now at a point where openings are few and far between leaving the game feeling a little too safe, at a higher level palyers will flail about with forgiving spacing and it will come down solely to timing.''

Before the game hit this point spacing was a lot more important and the game felt a lot more solid even though it was a little clunky at times. When an opponent made a mistake you could punish it and higher level play would be just that, higher level play.
